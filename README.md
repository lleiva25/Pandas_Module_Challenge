# Pandas_Module_Challenge

Purpose: This is a challenge that incorporates the principles learned from Python, Pandas, and Jupyter in order to analyze the district-wide standardized test results from a school district. Overall, the goal is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instructions: 
- District Summary should contain the following: {Total number of unique schools, Total students, Total budget, Average math score, Average reading score, % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math), % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading), and % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)}

- School Summary should contain the following: {Total number of unique schools, Total students, Total budget, Per student budget, Average math score, Average reading score, % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math), % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading), and % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)}

- Highest-Performing Schools will be sorted by '% Overall Passing' in descending order and display the top 5 rows.

- Lowest-Performing Schools will be sorted by '% Overall Passing' in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.

- Create a DataFrame that takes the average reading and math scores by student grade.

- Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student):
spending_bins = [0, 585, 630, 645, 680]
spending_labels = ["<$585", "$585-630", "$630-645", "$645-680"]
-Sort the schools by size using the following bin:
size_bins = [0, 1000, 2000, 5000]
labels = ["Small (<1000)", "Medium (1000-2000)", "Large (2000-5000)"]
-Create a DataFrame that shows the school performance based on "School Type"
